          <p>
            Reviews should focus on your personal experience with the game. They
            should not contain spoilers without appropriate warnings, offensive
            language, hate speech, or personal attacks against developers or

            reflect your honest opinion of the game. Deliberately manipulating
            ratings to inflate or deflate a game's overall score is prohibited.
